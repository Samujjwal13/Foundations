### Where and When
**Programming**: All code demos will be in Python so experience with it or another object-oriented programming language would be helpful for following along with the code examples.

**Mathematics**: Familiarity with secondary school-level mathematics will make the class easier to follow along with. If you are comfortable dealing with quantitative information -- such as understanding charts and rearranging simple equations -- then you should be well-prepared to follow along with all of the mathematics.
